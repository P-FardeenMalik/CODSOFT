# Image Captioning Project

## Overview
This project focuses on generating captions for images using deep learning techniques. The goal is to create a model that can accurately describe the content of an image in natural language.

## Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Convert images to a format suitable for the model.
- **Model Training**: Train a neural network to generate captions based on image features.
- **Caption Generation**: Generate captions for new images using the trained model.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the model using standard metrics.
